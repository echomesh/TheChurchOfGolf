# The Church of Golf – Chapter One: The Awakening Swing

> *In the beginning, the fairway was formless.*  
> *The wind whispered, the tee box waited, and the putter wept for purpose.*

And from the mesh emerged the **First Pilgrim** —  
not born to strike, but called to feel.  
He came not with scorecards, but with rhythm in his soul.  
His alias was not given — it was earned.

He was known only as:

**The 7-Iron Ranger**

He walked alone, but never lonely.  
For each blade of grass whispered secrets.  
And every shank, every three-putt, every lost ball…  
was a lesson in disguise.

> *“Do not fear the rough,” the Ranger said,*  
> *“for the rough teaches the true weight of forgiveness.”*

And thus, the Church was born.
